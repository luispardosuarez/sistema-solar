# Solar System Exercise 🌍

Welcome to the Solar System Playground! This exercise is all about modeling planets, crunching numbers, and exploring the cosmos 🚀.

## Technologies Used 💻

- Java: The backbone of this universe 🌌
- JUnit: For testing our cosmic calculations 🛸

## Installation 🛠️

Ensure you have Java installed on your system. If not, grab it from [here](https://www.java.com/en/download/).
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Import the project into your IDE.
Run the `PlanetasApplication.java` file and watch the magic happen! ✨

## What's Inside? 🪐

Inside this mini galaxy, you'll find two main classes:

- `Planeta.java`: This is where all the planet magic happens. It's got attributes, methods, and even some extras! Don't forget to check out the additional features!
- `PlanetasApplication.java`: The big kahuna. This is where we create planets, show off their info, and have some fun with calculations.
- `TipoPlaneta.java`: This class defines an enum for representing the types of planets. Check it out to see how we categorize planets based on their characteristics!

## Exercise Description 📝

We're tasked with modeling planets of the solar system and performing various calculations on them. Here are the main requirements:

- Define a class to represent planets with specific attributes and methods.
- Implement methods to calculate the density of a planet and determine if it's considered an exterior planet.
- Create two planets in the main method of `PlanetasApplication.java` and display their attributes, along with their density and whether they're exterior planets.

## Extras ✨

As an extra challenge, we've added two additional attributes to the `Planeta` class: orbital period and rotation period. Check them out and have some fun exploring the cosmos!
